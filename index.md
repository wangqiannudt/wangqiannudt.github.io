[ResearchGate Profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qian-Wang-120)

Welcome to my personal academic homepage. I am a researcher specializing in **Human-Machine Hybrid Intelligence**, currently working with the Intelligent Game and Decision Lab. My research focuses on the intersection of multiple fields, including Machine Learning, Robotics, Control Systems, and Computer Vision, with the goal of addressing key challenges in natural human-machine interaction and collaboration.

## About Me

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), where my research was dedicated to the application of high-performance computing (HPC) in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Having also completed my bachelor’s and master’s degrees at NUDT, I have developed a strong and comprehensive foundation in high-performance computing, enabling me to tackle complex computational challenges across various domains.

Throughout my academic journey, I have collaborated with multidisciplinary teams and contributed to projects in areas such as:

- **Research Area 1**: Developing hybrid intelligence systems that combine human expertise and machine learning to solve complex decision-making problems.
- **Research Area 2**: Exploring innovative approaches to human-computer interaction, focusing on enhancing user experience and collaboration with intelligent systems.
- **Research Area 3**: Designing and optimizing high-performance computing frameworks to support large-scale data processing and computational tasks.

## Publications & Projects

My current list of publications can be found on my [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qian-Wang-120), where I also share ongoing projects, preprints, and occasionally seek collaborators.

A dedicated [Publications](./publications.md) page is available for a more structured overview of my authored works, along with [Projects](./projects.md) where you can find links to open-source code, datasets, and project summaries.
